retrieved doc:  The history of the periodic table reflects over a century of growth in the understanding of chemical properties . The most important event in its history occurred in 1869 , when the table was published by Dmitri Mendeleev , who built upon earlier discoveries by scientists such as Antoine - Laurent de Lavoisier and John Newlands , but who is nevertheless generally given sole credit for its development .  

original doc:  In the early 1800s , John Dalton used the concept of atoms to explain why elements always react in ratios of small whole numbers ( the law of multiple proportions ) . For instance , there are two types of tin oxide : one is 88.1 % tin and 11.9 % oxygen and the other is 78.7 % tin and 21.3 % oxygen ( tin ( II ) oxide and tin dioxide respectively ) . This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5 g or 27g of oxygen . 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1 : 2 , a ratio of small whole numbers . This common pattern in chemistry suggested to Dalton that elements react in whole number multiples of discrete units -- in other words , atoms . In the case of tin oxides , one tin atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms .

retrieved doc:  There are several major additional characters introduced by the television series and numerous narrative details and the plotline differ radically from the source novel . For example , the planned Nazi pre-emptive nuclear strike on Japan , `` Operation Dandelion , '' is apparently being prevented only by Hitler 's personal refusal to authorise it , leading Heydrich and the faction demanding pre-emptive war to plot the Führer 's assassination . In addition , Hawthorne Abendsen does not appear in the first season of the television version and The Grasshopper Lies Heavy is a series of newsreel films depicting multiple alternative realities rather than a novel ( although this idea may actually be borrowed from Dick 's later novel Valis which features a mysterious film depicting yet another dystopian alternative history of the USA ) . As of the Season 1 finale , these films are being tracked down by SS agents like Blake for dispatch to Hitler for an as - yet - unknown purpose .  

original doc:  The play is a farcical black comedy revolving around the Brewster family , descended from the Mayflower , but now composed of insane homicidal maniacs . The hero , Mortimer Brewster , is a drama critic who must deal with his crazy , homicidal family and local police in Brooklyn , New York , as he debates whether to go through with his recent promise to marry the woman he loves .

retrieved doc:  A B - type main - sequence star ( BV ) is a main - sequence ( hydrogen - burning ) star of spectral type B and luminosity class V. These stars have from 2 to 16 times the mass of the Sun and surface temperatures between 10,000 and 30,000 K. B - type stars are extremely luminous and blue . Their spectra have neutral helium , which are most prominent at the B2 subclass , and moderate hydrogen lines . Examples include Regulus and Algol A .  

original doc:  The Sun is about halfway through its main - sequence stage , during which nuclear fusion reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium . Each second , more than four million tonnes of matter are converted into energy within the Sun 's core , producing neutrinos and solar radiation . At this rate , the Sun has so far converted around 100 times the mass of Earth into energy , about 0.03 % of the total mass of the Sun . The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 billion years as a main - sequence star . The Sun is gradually becoming hotter during its time on the main sequence , because the helium atoms in the core occupy less volume than the hydrogen atoms that were fused . The core is therefore shrinking , allowing the outer layers of the Sun to move closer to the centre and experience a stronger gravitational force , according to the inverse - square law . This stronger force increases the pressure on the core , which is resisted by a gradual increase in the rate at which fusion occurs . This process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser . It is estimated that the Sun has become 30 % brighter in the last 4.5 billion years . At present , it is increasing in brightness by about 1 % every 100 million years .
